        aboutText: "I'm a front-end web developer who apreciates the creative problem solving that comes with designing something beautiful, functional, and user-focused. The plentitude of new things to learn, and new skills to develop, satisfies my drive to always keep learning.\nMy work as a structural drafter taught me a lot about working on collaborative projects, and striving to create high-quality, detailed work on tight deadlines. I valued that time, but found a spark of passion with web design that led me to BCIT's Technical Web Design program. In my time there, I gained experience with a variety of web development tools and languages. I also discovered how much I love the creative problem solving that comes with designing something beautiful and functional.\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me searching out new cafes, planning my next trip, or working on any number of creative projects - lately I've been constructing miniature buildings, and learning to model 3D objects with voxels.",
